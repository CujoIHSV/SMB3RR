1) How It Works

This program takes a ROM file of Super Mario Bros. 3 (supplied by the user) and
produces a new ROM file with some or all of the levels shuffled around. The new
ROM can be produced randomly or from a seed provided by the user. The seed can
be either 6 characters (all levels randomized) or 19 characters (some levels
randomized) and can consist of upper or lower-case letters, numbers, '+' or '-'.
The newly created ROM filename contains the seed used to produce it, so that
other users can reproduce an identical ROM.


2) Known Issues

-   Secret areas in some levels do not work properly. Specifically, when you try
    to enter the secret areas, you are instead transported to a room without a
    floor, leading to an instant death. Unless you want to die, DO NOT enter the
    secret areas in the following levels:
    --  3-9
    --  4-F2
    --  5-2
    --  5-5
    --  6-3
    --  6-10
    --  7-8
    --  8-1
    
-   For various reasons, the following things cannot currently be randomized:
    --  4-F2
    --  5-tower
    --  6-F1
    --  6-F3
    --  7-F1
    --  Anything in world 8 other than 8-1 and 8-2
    --  Mushroom houses
    --  Hammer brothers/piranha plants
